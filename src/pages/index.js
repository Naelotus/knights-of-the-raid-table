      His scowl serves as a stark contrast to the tender affection
      Gunzy's <span style={{ textDecoration: 'underline #9be835'}}>supple</span> fingers
      were showing his feline companion. Waiting at the bus stop for the
      “specialist” he summoned to “court”,
      "How dare he make the king wait?" yells the self-proclaimed king of
      All-Over-The-Place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exhausted from pacing, he sits to stroke Catrick. “Of all my feline
      companions, you're my favorite Mr. Catrick Swayze,” Gunzy imagines running
      his fingers through Catrick’s fluffy mane. Catrick is a sphynx. For the
      moment. “No one loves daddy like you do. Yes you love daddy don't you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      The residue of his altercation at Planet Fitness earlier in the day lingers.
      "I'm so outraged at that gym attendant at Planet Fitness! How dare
      he <span style={{ textDecoration: 'underline #ff9438'}}>ostracize</span> me
      from my place of body worship!," he reflects. Catrick spontaneously erupts
      into a Persian. Gunzy is delighted. He likes it when Catrick becomes a persian.
      He continues muttering to Catrick, “So what if I indulged myself to a slice
      of pizza while revelling at myself on the thigh machine, bloody communists.”
    </p>
    <p>
      ...
    </p>
    <p>
      Earlier in the week Gunzy embarked on a VHS frenzy. He fingered and prodded
      boxes packed full of video tapes until he settled on a Three's Company binge.
      He determined it critical to examine what he believed to be the subtle sexual
      tension between Don Knotts and Suzanne Somers. He must decode the conspiracy.
      It was then he became inspired to make good on his 1991 New Year Resolution
      to "execute a workout routine". The sticky note was still there on the dusty
      tape marked: Wholesome Animal Sounds and Suggestive Exercise Commercials.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dub it Project Thick Thighs!" he celebrated then proceeded to
      parsimoniously mimic, into a mirror, the salacious thigh squeezing movements
      of the Thighmaster Toning System. "Practice makes perfect," he chuckled,
      camera in hand, Catrick pacing in and out of the field of view. He later
      marked this tape: Patriot Thighs That Will Make America Great Again.
      Catrick was a Siamese at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since project launch, Gunzy has, "been removed from the gym at least three
      times," Jenny commented to Austen, the head bro at Planet Fitness. She
      slapped him playfully and with a toothy grin she continued, "Why do you keep
      letting him in here?" It's the kind of toothy grin that implies sex in a
      public bathroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Austen flexed his bicep and imagined a steaming plate of corned beef hash,
      "He's hilarious. Didn't you see him there at the thigh master feeding his
      cat nibbles of cheese pizza? I let him stay until there is a complaint."
    </p>
    <p>
      ...
    </p>
    <p>
      The bus squeals to a stop and spits out Snitch, Gunzy's "specialist". "It's
      about time <span style={{ textDecoration: 'underline #ffe32c'}}>manservant</span>.
      You make me sit idle at your peril."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I apologize sire! I am at the mercy of the public transportation. The driver
      did not heed my pleas!" Snitch raged. The driver slams the folding door shut
      and zooms away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuses!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Snitch bows low and inquires, "Everything okay sire?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Vigorously massaging his thighs, Gunzy retorts, "I am sore from my workout.
      I did three sets of," he thinks of an amount of weight that might impress
      Snitch, "five hundred pounds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wow sire, I'm­—"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray," Gunzy inserts waving his hand dismissively satisfied, "what did
      learn from your meeting with the soothsayer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Behold!", Snitch ejaculated with a flourish, and a gay little bow.
      "The soothsayer sayeth, and you will heed. The earth is
      indeed <span style={{ textDecoration: 'underline #e85981'}}>spherical</span>,
      not flat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Balderdash!", came the expected retort. "That can not be true! You'd fall
      off the planet at night if that was so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But great he-who-shall-be-obeyed!", cries Snitch. "I only do your bidding
      ever since you saved me from myself that time when I almost did that thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Great drops of tears fall from Snitch's face. Pleadingly, "You remember that
      thing don't you? That thing I almost did."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gunzy slowly shifts his gaze to the left then to the right, up, down and
      once around clockwise for good luck. Clearly not recalling Snitch’s plight,
      his voice wavers as he hesitantly answers, “yes...?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Relief washes over Snitch as his faith in his employer is restored stimulating
      a sense of self-righteousness. Gunzy scratches his head visibly disturbed by
      Snitch. I've got to stop hiring these discount cronies off Craigslist, he
      thinks. <em>I tasked him to uncover the truth of the prophecy and he comes back
        to me with the earth is rou­—</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Sudden realization pierces the King like an arrow through the heart.
      Clutching his chest, he drops Catrick who lets out a shrill "mrrrow" in
      protest. His face transitions from shock to fear to utter fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Spherical! " Gunzy spits unable to contain his disgust. "If what this so-called
      soothsayer asserts is true, who knows what's out there? Imagine the
      delinquents tramping around outside my <span style={{ textDecoration: 'underline #3afffa'}}>bailiwick</span>!"
      He lets out a scornful laugh. "No, I can't have that. I want to see this
      soothsayer myself."
